# GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) - DefectDojo Integration

This repository contains the necessary scripts to import GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) findings into DefectDojo.

## DefectDojo

In order to import GHAS findings we should use as `Scan Type`: 

- `GitHub Vulnerability Scan` for Security Updates from Dependabot
- `SARIF` for Code Scanning Alerts
- `??` for Secret Scanning Alerts


We can do it manually or using the DefectDojo API, througt the Commnand Line Interface (CLI) or the REST API.
